# Wireless_Communication_Project

In Wireless communication, to improve data rate and reliability of the system multiple antennas are 
incorporated in the transmitter and receiver referred to as MIMO systems. MIMO systems can be of 
different configuration and different schemes can be employed to them depending on how much 
information is available at the transmitter. In this project different spatial diversity schemes with and 
without transmitter channel knowledge is simulated and their performance in compared. Also, spatial 
multiplexing systems with suboptimal linear detectors are simulated and comparison between different 
detection schemes are made.
